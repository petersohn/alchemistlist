This Android app allows you to more efficiently experiment on Alchemy in Skyrim. Features:
- Keep track of experiments already taken
- Keep track of the effect of each ingredient
- Predict the result of future experiments
- Review relation between ingredients and effects
- Multiple databases

Since this app contains no pre-built data, it can be used for modded versions of the game with potentially different ingredients and effects.
